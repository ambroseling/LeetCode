# m*n is # of cells in the matrix,  
# In the worst case, each cell in the board is visited, and for each cell, 
# the DFS traversal might explore up to 4 directions. 
# The total number of DFS calls is bounded by the number of cells, (m*n)
# so If a word has length L, each DFS call can explore up to 4 branches for each character, resulting in 
# 4 ùêø combinations in the worst case.


# Space complexity: The Trie can have at most L nods, where L is the number of characters in the total # of characters in all the words
# Therefore space complexity of the Trie is O(L)
# The recursion stack can go as deep as the longest word length k in the worst case, the visit set uses O(m*n) space
# Therefore total space complexity is: O(L + m*n)

        Intuition:
        1. Use a Trie (prefix tree) to efficiently store and look up words from the list.
        2. Traverse each cell on the board and use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible words starting from that cell.
        3. Use a set to keep track of visited cells during the DFS to avoid revisiting them in the same path.
        4. If a complete word is found in the Trie during DFS traversal, add it to the result set.
        5. Use a set to store the result words to avoid duplicates and convert it to a list at the end.
